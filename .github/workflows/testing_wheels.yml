  # For efficiency, we skip this workflow if the file changes only involve docs.
  # Here's an explanation of the approach used. GitHub Actions workflows can
  # have path filters (i.e., the use of "paths:" keywords on event triggers),
  # and that *would* be the natural way to run workflows only when the relevant
  # files change â€“ except that the way GitHub branch protection rules work is:
  # "If a workflow is skipped due to path filtering [...] the checks associated
  # with that workflow will remain in a Pending state. A PR that requires those
  # checks to be successful will be blocked from merging." Our approach forgoes
  # path filters, and instead checks file changes using a preliminary job.
