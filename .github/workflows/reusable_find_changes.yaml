# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Explanation for why file changes are tested using this workflow.
#
# GitHub Actions workflows path filters (i.e., adding "paths:" keywords to
# event triggers) would be the natural way to trigger workflows only when
# relevant files are changed in a PR â€“ except that the way GitHub branch
# protection rules work is: "If a workflow is skipped due to path filtering
# [...] the checks associated with that workflow will remain in a Pending
# state. A PR that requires those checks to be successful will be blocked from
# merging." This makes path filters unusable with merge queues. We forgo the
# use of path filters, and instead check file changes using our own workflow.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# The tilde is only to make our reusable workflows be listed last in the UI.
